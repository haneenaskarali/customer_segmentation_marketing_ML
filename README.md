# Customer Segmentation for Smarter Marketing Strategies

This project uses machine learning to perform customer segmentation for digital marketing strategies. By using K-Means clustering, it identifies distinct customer groups based on demographic and behavioral attributes. This segmentation helps businesses target their marketing campaigns more effectively.

## Project Overview

In digital marketing, understanding customer behavior is key to personalizing campaigns and maximizing ROI. This project uses *K-Means Clustering*, an unsupervised learning technique, to segment customers into groups based on their demographic data and purchasing behavior. The segmentation results will guide marketing teams to tailor their campaigns more effectively, ultimately driving better customer engagement.

## Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle with generalized marketing campaigns that fail to effectively engage all customer types. Without proper segmentation, marketing efforts can be misdirected, leading to poor resource allocation and reduced campaign effectiveness. This project solves the problem by clustering customers into meaningful segments based on their attributes, enabling better-targeted marketing efforts.

## Proposed Solution

The project uses *K-Means Clustering* to divide customers into distinct segments. These segments are identified based on attributes such as age, income, and spending behavior. The clustering results are visualized using Python libraries to give marketers actionable insights on how to target different customer groups. This will lead to more personalized campaigns, improved engagement, and better marketing ROI.

## System Approach

1. *Input Data:*  
   The input data consists of the *customer_segmentation_data.csv* file, which includes features like age, income, and spending score.

2. *Preprocessing:*  
   The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical columns, and visualize the data for better understanding.

3. *Clustering Model:*  
   *K-Means Clustering* is used to segment customers into distinct groups based on their attributes.

4. *Output:*  
   The output is the list of customer segments with associated labels, followed by insights such as the size of each segment, average spend, and income.

5. *Visualization:*  
   Segmentation results are visualized with charts such as pie charts and bar graphs to make the results easy to interpret.

## Algorithm Used

- *K-Means Clustering:*  
  K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data points into a specified number of clusters. It works by minimizing the variance within each cluster and grouping similar customers together.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the *Customer Segmentation Data, available on **Kaggle*. You can find the dataset and download it using the following link:

- [Customer Segmentation Data For Marketing analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahmidachowdhury/customer-segmentation-data-for-marketing-analysis)

The dataset contains customer demographic details like age, gender, annual income, and spending behavior. This data is used to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means algorithm.

## Results

Upon running the K-Means algorithm, the dataset was segmented into *4 distinct clusters*. These clusters represent different customer groups based on their spending behavior and demographics:

1. *Cluster 0:* High-income, high-spending customers  
2. *Cluster 1:* Older customers with moderate spending  
3. *Cluster 2:* Budget-conscious customers  
4. *Cluster 3:* Low-income, low-spending customers

These segments can help businesses create targeted marketing strategies for each group.
